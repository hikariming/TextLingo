> 📢 **Note**: This project was previously known as **TextLingo**. We've renamed it to **OpenKoto** (Open + 言/ことば, meaning "word" in Japanese) to better reflect our vision of open-source reading, translation, and language learning.

## What is OpenKoto?

OpenKoto Desktop is an **open-source, AI-powered language learning application** that transforms any content you're interested in into an immersive learning experience. Beyond language learning, it also serves as a **powerful reader and translation tool**. Unlike traditional language learning apps, OpenKoto lets you learn from **real-world content** — song lyrics, news articles, blog posts, or any text that sparks your interest.

Built with **Tauri + React + Rust**, it runs locally on your machine for **fast performance and complete privacy**.

> 🎯 **Perfect for**: Japanese learners, English learners, polyglots, and anyone who wants to learn languages through content they actually enjoy!
